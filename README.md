# Genome Assembly
When the genome of a species is to be sequenced, the chromosomes from many cells are broken at random positions into small fragments, which are sequenced, and reassembled into long sequences (contigs). Contigs may be assembled into longer sequences. The resulting collection of sequences after assembly is called a genome assembly. De Bruijn graph-based assembly approach was originally proposed to handle the assembly of repetitive regions better.

# Project Overview
The project works on assembling two types of reads (Single and Paired) using the De Bruijn graph representation and the Eulerian path to obtain the original sequence from that representation.
